Hello [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com) Family, I am embarking on this journey with the objective of learning and mastering [**DevOps**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrgk023l4lI). Some of the basics skills to learn in this roadmap includes

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, Centos, RHEL)
- **Virtualization** (VirtualBox, VMware ESXi, VMware Fusion)
- **Networking**
- **Scripting**
- **DevOps Tools** (Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes)

### What is DevOps

Imagine that you and your classmates are engaged in a significant group project. Every team member has a role to play - someone does the research, someone does the designing, someone writes, and someone else presents. However, while working on the project, the team runs into a number of issues, including misunderstandings, delays, glitches, and changes.

There are various teams involved in software development, including the research team (developers), the design team (designers), the writing/documentation team (QA and Testing), and the presentation team (operations), much like there were in the group project.

DevOps is like a set of teamwork strategies, tools, and processes that help different groups work together better to create software that's faster, more reliable, and of higher quality.

⚙️ **Collaboration:** DevOps helps these teams talk to each other more. Developers talk to designers, testers also talk to developers, and everyone knows what's happening.
⚙️ **Speed:** With DevOps, we use tools and processes to make things faster, hence making changes quickly, and the final product gets to users faster.
⚙️ **Quality:** DevOps detects early mistakes in the software before it gets deployed for customers. It's like having lots of testers making sure everything works well.
⚙️ **Feedback:** The DevOps team releases better software products based on consumer feedback.
⚙️ **Automation:** Think of having a robot that can format the text perfectly so the writer doesn't need to worry. DevOps uses automation tools to do repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.
