Hi there! Welcome to AWS Cloud9!

To get started, create some files, play with the terminal,
or visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloud9/ for our documentation.

Happy coding!

In this module, I learned how to use Docker Compose to build our appliction locally and how I can add networking and storage components to the application by defining those resources in my docker-compose files. In the next module, I will be taking the application I built and modernized it by deploying it to Amazon ECS and adding AWS specific resources through the same methodology used in this module.

I decided to make the deployment easier and faster by creating she bash scripts __aws-cli-setup.sh__ and __docker-install.sh__

## Setbacks on this project
- High CPU usage causing the environment to hang up
- Low disk space

## Recommendation
- Choose an EC2 instance that has high CPU and storage
